Research Project
• Finding Similar Projects in GitHub using Word Embedding
Leveraged Word2Vec word embedding and Word Mover Distance (WMD)
to measure the similarity of GitHub projects utilizing projects’ source
code and available textual description.
• Privacy in Information Retrieval
Proposed a client-centered approach to hide user intents that prevent
search engine from building user profile by injecting cover queries with
the original user issued query in a controlled way. Each user’s query
is submitted with a set of cover queries which carry similar amount of
information to generalize user profile while still having some personalization
• Sentiment analysis from social media data
Used text processing techniques to generate features and supervised
learning techniques to detect insulting vs non-insulting comments from
the text
Undergraduate Thesis
• Future Computing and Quantum Computer
In this thesis, we attempted to find a polynomial time solution of NPcomplete problems using alternate approaches to classical computers
and by bypassing the impasse of NP-completeness.In this thesis, we
explored in details two basic quantum algorithms- Deutsch and DeutschJozsa and proposed a 2-qubit modification of Deutsch and DeutschJozsa quantum algorithm. We discussed a particular type of solution
and proposed a different type of analog computer which uses the soapfilm property to solve Steiner Tree problem, which is a NP-complete
problem, in polynomial time.
